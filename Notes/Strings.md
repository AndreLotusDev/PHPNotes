# Strings
# Interpolation

```php
$name = "John Doe";
echo "Hello, $name";  
```

---

# String scape

```php
$quote = "He said, \"Hello, John Doe.\"";
echo $quote; 
```

- `\\` - Backslash
- `\'` - Single quote (only necessary in single-quoted strings)
- `\"` - Double quote (only necessary in double-quoted strings)
- `\n` - New line
- `\r` - Carriage return
- `\t` - Horizontal tab
- `\b` - Backspace
- `\f` - Form feed
- `\v` - Vertical tab (from PHP 5.2.5)
- `\0` - NUL-byte
- `\xNN` - Hexadecimal representation of a character (e.g., `\x41` for 'A')
- `\u{NNNN}` - Unicode code point escape syntax (from PHP 7.0.0, e.g., `\u{1F602}` for ðŸ˜‚)

### Notes:
1. In single-quoted strings (`' '`), escape sequences like `\n`, `\r`, `\t`, etc., are not processed and will be output as is.
2. In double-quoted strings (`" "`), these escape sequences will be processed and output their corresponding characters.
3. The `\xNN` and `\u{NNNN}` syntax allow for a broader range of characters to be represented.
